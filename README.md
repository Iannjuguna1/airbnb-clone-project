## 1. Team Roles and Responsibilities
Each team member contributes to different areas of the project:

- **Backend Developer:**  
  Responsible for designing and implementing APIs, handling business logic, and integrating the database with the application.  

- **Frontend Developer:**  
  Builds user interfaces and ensures seamless user experiences using frameworks such as React or similar technologies.  

- **Database Administrator (DBA):**  
  Designs, maintains, and optimizes the project’s relational database, ensuring data consistency and performance.  

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  Manages CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and deployment environments to ensure smooth operations.  

- **Project Manager:**  
  Oversees team coordination, task distribution, and ensures milestones are completed on schedule.  

---

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Django:** Backend web framework used to build APIs and manage application logic.  
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL:** Relational database system for structured data storage and management.  
- **GraphQL:** Query language used to fetch and manipulate API data efficiently.  
- **Docker:** Containerization platform that simplifies environment setup and deployment.  
- **GitHub Actions:** CI/CD automation tool for testing and deployment workflows.  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For building responsive and dynamic front-end interfaces.  

---

## 3. Database Design
The database will include the following key entities:

- **Users:**  
  Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`  
  A user can list properties, make bookings, and write reviews.  

- **Properties:**  
  Fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price`, `owner_id`  
  Each property is owned by a user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.  

- **Bookings:**  
  Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status`  
  Each booking is linked to one user and one property.  

- **Reviews:**  
  Fields: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`  
  A user can review multiple properties, and each property can have multiple reviews.  

- **Payments:**  
  Fields: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `transaction_date`  
  Each payment is tied to a booking and records transaction details.  

**Relationships:**
- A **User** can have many **Properties** and **Bookings**.  
- A **Property** can have many **Reviews** and **Bookings**.  
- Each **Booking** corresponds to one **Payment**.
